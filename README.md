### Electric-Cycle-Data-Analysis
Given a dataset, the goal is to understand:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
2. How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands.

The project uses different statistical tests like t-test, chi-square tests, ANOVA, Kruskal's test, etc. to analyze the effect of the features on demand.
